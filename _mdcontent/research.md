# Research & Papers

---

My research broadly falls under the field of public economics. Currently, I am focused on the economics of crime and privacy, with a particular interest on cybercrime. In my dissertation I study the impact of public policy and technology shifts on the market for stolen data. Previously, I have worked on issues related to tax and transfer programs.
