# About Me

---

I'm currently an Economics PhD student at the University of Virginia. I work on open source policy
modeling with a primary focus on tax models in the [Policy Simulation Library](https://www.pslmodels.org)
(PSL). Prevoiusly, I worked as a research associate in the
[Open Source Policy Center](https://www.ospc.org) at the [American Enterprise Institute](www.aei.org).

I earned a BA in Economics from The University of Texas at Austin.
