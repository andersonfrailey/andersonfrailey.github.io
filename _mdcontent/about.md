# About Me

---

I'm currently a research associate in the [Open Source Policy Center](https://www.ospc.org)
at the [American Enterprise Institute](www.aei.org). I work on open source policy
modeling with a primary focus on tax models.

I earned a BA in Economics from The University of Texas at Austin and will be
joining the Economics PhD program at the University of Virginia this fall.
