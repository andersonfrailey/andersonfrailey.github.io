# About

---

I'm currently an Economics PhD candidate at the University of Virginia. In my spare time I work on a number of open source projects including tax models in the [Policy Simulation Library](https://www.pslmodels.org)
(PSL), [blackjack simulators](https://github.com/andersonfrailey/blackjack), and [MLB projection models](https://github.com/andersonfrailey/satchel). Previously, I worked as a research associate in the
[Open Source Policy Center](https://www.ospc.org) within the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org).

I earned a BA in Economics from The University of Texas at Austin and MA in
Economics from the University of Virginia.
