# Anderson Frailey

I am a sixth year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on the economics of privacy and information, with a particular interest in cybercrime.

Occasionally (seldomly), I'll write about projects I'm working on and you can find my most recent posts below. I recently open sourced my MLB projection model and you can find those projections [here](https://andersonfrailey.github.io/mlb-projections).
