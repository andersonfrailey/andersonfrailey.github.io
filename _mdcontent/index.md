I am a sixth year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on the economics of privacy and information, with a particular interest in cybercrime. I will be graduating in May 2025 and am on the 2024-2025 job market. My CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lVFmPya0iHnaV6ptNQFdAu7LKA4hGFuA/view?usp=sharing).

Occasionally (seldomly), I'll write about projects I'm working on and you can find my most recent posts below. I recently open sourced Satchel, my MLB projection model, and you can find those projections [here](https://andersonfrailey.github.io/mlb-projections).
