# MLB Projections

---

My MLB projections are generated using the Satchel projection model. I wrote a brief description of how the model works [in an earlier post](https://andersonfrailey.github.io/blog/Building-an-MLB-Prediction-Model-in-an-Evening.html), and it has since grown into a more substantive project. The source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/andersonfrailey/satchel/tree/main).
