# MLB Projections

---

My MLB projections are generated using the Satchel projection model. I wrote a brief description of how the model works [in an earlier post](https://andersonfrailey.github.io/blog/Building-an-MLB-Prediction-Model-in-an-Evening.html), and it has since grown into a more substantive project. The source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/andersonfrailey/satchel/tree/main).

These projections are updated automatically every morning during the season around 10AM Eastern. The last column, "Season Percentile", grades how the team is projected to finish (in terms of total wins) relative to their opening day projections. A team that's roughly meeting expectations will have a percentile around 50. Those that dramatically over or underperform will have scores significantly higher and lower than 50, respectively.
