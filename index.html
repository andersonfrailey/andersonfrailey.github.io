            <p>I am an assistant professor in the economics department at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and an affiliate of the UMBC Cybersecurity Institute. My research focuses on the economics of privacy and information, with a particular interest in cybercrime.

<p>Occasionally (seldomly), I'll write about projects I'm working on, You can find my most recent posts below. I recently open sourced Satchel, my MLB projection model, and you can find its projections for the current season <a href="https://andersonfrailey.github.io/mlb-projections">here</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="https://andersonfrailey.github.io/files/supply_of_stolen_data.pdf"><strong><em>The Effects of Privacy Regulation on the Supply of Stolen Data</em></strong></a></p>
<p>Abstract: <em>Individuals are constantly generating streams of data collected by businesses, educational institutions, data brokers, and many other organizations. These organizations are regularly targeted by cyber criminals attempting to steal that data in order to exploit or sell it in online markets. In this paper I propose a model of the stolen data economy to show how privacy regulations may affect the market. I then introduce a novel dataset of data breaches to study the effects of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a policy governing the collection and storage of user data, on the quantity of data available in the illicit market. Using a difference-in-differences design, I find that the GDPR caused a 60 percent reduction in the number of data breaches traded, but no reduction in the aggregate amount of data available. Analyzing the contents of the individual breaches, I find a nearly 70 percent increase in the amount of data they contain. These results are consistent with the model's prediction that low-value hacking targets becoming disproportionally less valuable after the GDPR, which in turn causes higher-value targets to make up a larger portion of post-GDPR data breaches.</em></p>

        <p>To date, the best thing about the Angels' year has been their City Connect jerseys.
Despite having two of the best players in baseball in Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani,
they are 10.5 games out of the Wild Card race, and 20.5 in the division. In an
effort to see if their season was truly lost, I set out to find a series of trades
that would give them at least a 50% chance of making the postseason according
to Satchel, my MLB projections model.</p>

        <a href="blog/Satchel-2021-Autopsy.html" class="blog_link"><h3>Satchel Season in Review - 2021</h3></a>
        <p>As everyone knows, the best time to write about modeling the MLB season is during a lockout, so here is the very belated Satchel 2021 season autopsy. There were some great predictions, and some very big misses, but overall, I'd say Satchel held its own. I compare Satchel with the projections published by FanGraphs before the season started since all of the underlying data comes from FanGraphs.</p>

        <p>I'll leave the detailed commentary to the professionals, but with opening day just around the corner, here's how my model (henceforth known as Satchel) has the 2021 MLB season playing out.<sup>1</sup> For an overview of how the model works, check out my earlier <a href="https://andersonfrailey.github.io/blog/Building-an-MLB-Prediction-Model-in-an-Evening.html">post</a>. I'll also talk about how the model has changed since I first introduced it at the end of this post.</p>
