                <p>Blackjack has long been one of the most popular games you’ll find in a casino. Its simplicity makes it an easy option for beginners and the relatively modest house edge appeals to more seasoned gamblers. The game also has a strong history of detailed computational analysis. Ed Thorpe’s classic, <em>Beat the Dealer</em>, has been regarded as the gold standard in blackjack analysis since its publication in 1966. In it, Thorpe uses an IBM 704 to simulate games of blackjack, ultimately determining the best strategy for a player (now known as basic strategy). Inspired by Thorpe (and <em><a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/adam-kucharski/the-perfect-bet/9781541697232/">The Perfect Bet</a></em> by Adam Kucharski), I set out to create a modern blackjack simulator. The result is Py21.</p>

                <p>Since the adoption of Statcast by Major League Baseball, fans have had access to pitch-by-pitch data for every regular season game.
These data include pitch velocity and location, the result of the pitch, even who was playing left field at the time.
Numerous tools have been built to access these data, most notably <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com">Baseball Savant</a>, which provides a relatively straight forward user interface for finding the information you want.</p>

                <p>Throughout tax reform season a seemingly endless stream of tables, plots, and charts filled Twitter to show the distributional effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I particularly liked <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-we-can-better-visualize-analysis-tax-reform-legislation">Jonathan Schwabish’s piece</a> on how he created a graph to make a report by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) more engaging. I decided to recreate his work using <a href="https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/">Bokeh</a> and the open-source <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/">Tax-Calculator</a>.</p>
